These vertex attributes will be finally provided to the {@link clay.Shader}.\n * Different {@link clay.Shader} needs different attributes. Here is a list of attributes used in the builtin shaders.\n *\n * + position: `clay.basic`, `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + texcoord0: `clay.basic`, `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + color: `clay.basic`, `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + weight: `clay.basic`, `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + joint: `clay.basic`, `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + normal: `clay.lambert`, `clay.standard`\n * + tangent: `clay.standard`\n *\n * #### Create a procedural geometry\n *\n * ClayGL provides a couple of builtin procedural geometries.

Here is a simple example to create a triangle.\n```js\nvar TRIANGLE_POSITIONS = [\n    [-0.5, -0.5, 0],\n    [0.5, -0.5, 0],\n    [0, 0.5, 0]\n];\nvar geometry = new clay.StaticGeometryBase();\n// Add triangle vertices to position attribute.\ngeometry.attributes.position.fromArray(TRIANGLE_POSITIONS);\n```\n * Then you can use the utility methods like `generateVertexNormals`, `generateTangents` to create the remaining necessary attributes.\n *\n *\n * #### Use with custom shaders\n *\n * If you wan't to write custom shaders. Don't forget to add SEMANTICS to these attributes. For example\n *\n ```glsl\nuniform mat4 worldViewProjection : WORLDVIEWPROJECTION;\nuniform mat4 worldInverseTranspose : WORLDINVERSETRANSPOSE;\nuniform mat4 world : WORLD;\n\nattribute vec3 position : POSITION;\nattribute vec2 texcoord : TEXCOORD_0;\nattribute vec3 normal : NORMAL;\n```\n * These `POSITION`, `TEXCOORD_0`, `NORMAL` are SEMANTICS which will map the attributes in shader to the attributes in the GeometryBase\n *\n * Available attributes SEMANTICS includes `POSITION`, `TEXCOORD_0`, `TEXCOORD_1` `NORMAL`, `TANGENT`, `COLOR`, `WEIGHT`, `JOINT`.\n *\n *\n * @constructor clay.Geometry\n * @extends clay.GeometryBase\n */\nvar Geometry = __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__GeometryBase__[\"a\" /* default */].extend(function () {\n    return /** @lends clay.Geometry# */ {\n        /**\n         * Attributes of geometry.
